EnduroX is Open Source Middleware Platform for Distributed Transaction Processing

Platform provides X/Open XATMI and XA APIs for C/C++ applications. EnduroX can be considered as replacement for Oracle(R) Tuxedo(R), Jboss Blacktie (Narayan), Hitache OpenTP1 and other XATMI middlewares.

EnduroX provides SOA architecture for C/C++ applications and allows to cluster application in fault tolerant way over multiple physical servers. EnduroX provides Oracle(R) Tuxedo(R) FML/FML32 library emulation, including boolean expressions. Other Tuxedo specific APIs are supported, such as tpforward() and work with distributed transactions (tpbegin(), tpcommit(), etc.).

Supported operating system: GNU/Linux, starting from 2.6.12 kernel (needed for POSIX Queues). Starting with Enduro/X Version 3.1.2 IBM AIX (6.1 and 7.1), Oracle Solaris 11, MAC OS X (experimental) and Cygwin (experimental) support is added. Supported compilers: gcc, LLVM clang, IBM xlC.
