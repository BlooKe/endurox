DESCRIPTION
-----------
Function is used to terminate service processing and return control to caller. The return buffer 'data' must be auto buffer or allocated by *tpalloc()*. Len is needed in case if buffer type is not self describing. Internally function uses long jump to get back to internal message polling mechanisms. *tpreturn()* is used for normal service calls and for conversational service calls. *tpdiscon()* shall not be used by service program, but use *tpreturn()* instead. 'rcode' field is used by user program, to return back the specific value to caller.

*'rval'* values:

*TPSUCCESS* service terminated with success.

*TPFAIL* service terminated with failure. In case of global transaction, this return value will mark it as abort only.

*'flags'* values:

*TPSOFTTIMEOUT* soft timeout occurred. This can be used to simulate *TPETIME* error for caller. In this case 'rcode' is set to *TPETIME*, that is later used at client side for *tpreturn(3)* to respond with XATMI error.


This function is available only for XATMI servers.
