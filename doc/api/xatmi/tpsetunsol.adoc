NAME
----
tpsetunsol - Call XATMI service asynchronously


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

int tpsetunsol(char *'svc', char *'data', long 'len', long 'flags');


For XATMI client link with '-latmiclt -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

For XATMI server link with '-latmisrv|-latmisrvnomain|-latmisrvinteg -latmi -lubf -lnstd -lpthread -lrt -lm'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Call the XATMI service by given 'svc' name asynchronously. The 'data' is optional input XATMI buffer. If it is not a NULL, then it must be allocated with *tpcalloc()* call, 'len' is used for buffer types such *CARRAY*, where buffer length is not described by type. If call succeeds, the function return the call descriptor. With call descriptor it is possible later to receive the response by using *tpgetrply()* If *TPNOTRAN* is not specified and current process is in global transaction, then system will make destination process run in same destination process.

*Valid flags*

*TPNOTRAN* Do not call service in transaction mode. This is effective in case if caller process is running in transaction mode, but destination process shall not run in the same global transaction

*TPSIGRSTRT* Restart the system call in progress if interrupted by signal handler. This affects only underlaying mq_* function calls.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *tpsetunsol()* return call descriptor (>0); on error, -1 is returned, with *tperrno* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid parameter is given to function. Either service name is NULL or flags does not allow to change the value.

*TPENOENT* No service ('svc' parameter) advertised in system.

*TPETIME* Service did not reply in given time ('NDRX_TOUT'). 

*TPESVCFAIL* Service returned 'TPFAIL'. This is application level failure.

*TPESVCERR* System level service failure. Server died during the message presence in service queue.

*TPESYSTEM* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
