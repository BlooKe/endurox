NAME
----
tprealloc - Reallocated previously allocated XATMI buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <atmi.h>

char *tprealloc(char *'ptr', long 'size');


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reallocate (change the buffer size) of previously allocated resources by *tpalloc()*. The XATMI buffer is passed in with 'ptr' parameters and new size is provided in 'size' parameter. It is allowed to resize auto-allocated buffers (i.e. buffer that is passed into *TPSVCINFO.data* field.)

RETURN VALUE
------------
In case of success, function returns possibly new pointer of re-allocated memory. The pointer could be the same, for example if size is not changed of the buffer.
In case of failure, function returns NULL and *tperrno* returns the error code.

ERRORS
------
Note that *tpstrerror()* returns generic error message plus custom message with debug info from last function call.

*TPEINVAL* Invalid 'ptr' pointer passed in. Either buffer not allocated by *tpalloc()* or 'ptr' is NULL.

*TPEOS* System failure occurred during serving. See logs i.e. user log, or debugs for more info.
