NAME
----
Bchg - Change UBF buffer


SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <ubf.h>

int Bchg (UBFH *p_ub, BFLDID bfldid, BFLDOCC occ, char * buf, BFLDLEN len);


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Change the buffer value. 'p_ub' is pointer to UBF buffer, either allocated with 'tpcalloc()' with 'UBF' buffer type, or some other memory block which later is initialized with 'Binit()'. 'bfldid' is field ID which needs to be set. Field id is generated by 'mkfldhdr' utlity. 'buf' is pointer to memory containing the value. *Note* that buffer type in memory must match type field type i.e. char, short, long, float, double, string or carray (byte array). 'len' is used only for fields which need a lenght specifyer, i.e. carray.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, *Bchg()* return zero; on error, -1 is returned, with *Berror* set to indicate the error.


ERRORS
------
*BALIGNERR* Corrupted buffer or pointing to not aligned memory area.

*BNOTFLD* Buffer not fielded, not correctly allocated or corrupted.

*BNOSPACE* No space in buffer for string data.

*BBADFLD* Invalid field id passed.
