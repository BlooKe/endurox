NAME
----
cconfsrv - Common configuration server

SYNOPSIS
--------
*cconfsrv*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is sepcial XATMI server shipped with Enduro/X in order to provide common-configuration (ini file) parsing facilities
to all programming languages which are provided by Enduro/X. The idea behind the configuration server is that it
uses XATMI API (exposed as service) in order to get configuration section or list all configuration that is used by 
application. 

This server is optional and can be used by third party application in oder to read the configuration files via standard
XATMI service calls.


API - get section
-----------------
The server can work in two modes.

1. Get mode ('EX_CC_CMD' UBF buffer set to 'g' (default)). In this mode the request for configuration is made for particular
section.  The config files (or directories) for which to do the lookup can be set in 'EX_CC_RESOURCE' field, you may use
multiple occurrences. If field is not set, then lookup is done in all files which are loaded into configuration library. This
includes Enduro/X own config files, which are set in *NDRX_CCONFIG* environment variables (see ex_env(5)). The get request
must contain 'EX_CC_LOOKUPSECTION' field, which indicates the section to lookup.

'EX_CC_LOOKUPSECTION' can be set to lookup the sub-sections, for example if you have in config files:

/paht/to/test1.ini:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[TEST1]
PARAM1=value1
PARAM2=value2

[TEST1/SUB1]
PARAM3=value3
PARAM5=value5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/path/to/test2.ini:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[TEST1/SUB1/SUB2]
PARAM3=value4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then by doing lookup to 'TEST1/SUB1/SUB2' section, you will get following result:

Request buffer:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EX_CC_CMD   g
EX_CC_LOOKUPSECTION TEST1/SUB1/SUB2
EX_CC_RESOURCE  /paht/to/test1.ini
EX_CC_RESOURCE  /paht/to/test2.ini
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response buffer:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EX_CC_SECTION   test1
EX_CC_KEY   PARAM1
EX_CC_VALUE   value1
EX_CC_SECTION   test2
EX_CC_KEY   PARAM2
EX_CC_VALUE   value2
EX_CC_SECTION   TEST1/SUB1/SUB2
EX_CC_KEY   PARAM3
EX_CC_VALUE   value4
EX_CC_SECTION   TEST1/SUB1
EX_CC_KEY   PARAM5
EX_CC_VALUE   value5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mention that 'PARAM3' value is set to 'value4' and not 'value3', because 'TEST1/SUB1/SUB2' closer matched the lookup request.
The principle is that all parent variables are gathered. If any variable is common between parent and child, then child element
will be returned, as it is with higher priority.

When doing requests to configuration server it is possible to request for mandatory field keys checking. The must-have keys are loaded into 'EX_CC_MANDATORY' field occurrences. If during section lookup key is not found, then error '6' is returned.

It is possible request format verification. The key-format fields are used into 'EX_CC_FORMAT_KEY' + 'EX_CC_FORMAT_FORMAT' occurrences. If the format does not match field, error code '7' is returned.

*'EX_CC_FORMAT_FORMAT' field can have following values:*

*t* - Boolean field, valid values starts with on of the following symbols: 'TtFfYyNn10'.

*sX..Y* or *s..Y* (e.g. s10..20, s..5) - String field, min length X and max length Y. If X is not set (second format), then X is assumed to be 0.

*iX..Y* or *i..Y* (e.g. i1..2, i..3) - Integer field, min len (measured as string) X and max len (measured as string Y.

*nX..Y* or *n..Y* (e.g. n2..5, n..3) - Numeric field (can be floating point format). Min length X (measured as string) and max length Y (measured as string).

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
