NAME
----
buildserver - Build XATMI server


SYNOPSIS
--------
*buildserver* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Build client is Perl script which is used for building XATMI server process.
buildserver script was added to Enduro/X for better compatibility with competitor
software. It is not mandatory to use the buildserver. The Enduro/X server
processes can be built as a standard C/C++ binaries. Buildclient script basically
invokes C compiler, with specified output binary name and list of object files to
include in the link. The link process is appended with standard Enduro/X dynamic
libraries which are intended for server use.

By comparing to the Oracle (R) Tuxedo (R) *buildclient* version, Enduro/X does
not process the '-s' paramter. Meaning that automatic service advertises are
not performed. Thus to migrate from Tuxedo to Enduro/X the *tpadvertise(3)* 
must be used, e.g.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void SOMESVC (TPSVCINFO *p_svc)
{
   ...
}

int tpsvrinit(int argc, char **argv)
{

    /* advertises service in init instead of -s argument. */
    if (0!=tpadvertise("SOMESVC", SOMESVC))
    {
        ...
    }
}


void tpsvrdone(void)
{
    ...
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
[*CC*]::
Optional environment variable indicating which C compiler to use. If parameter is
not set, the *cc* command is used.

[*CFLAGS*]::
Optional C flags to be passed to C compiler during the *cc* execution.

[*NDRX_HOME*]::
Optional environment variable indicating the Enduro/X installation home. If variable
is set then, "-I$NDRX_HOME/include" is added to *cc* command line for including
Enduro/X headers.

OPTIONS
-------
*-o* 'OUTPUT_BINARY'::
Output binary name passed to *cc*.

*-f* 'INTPUT_FILES']::
List of input files (must be passed in quotes, space separated) to the C compiler.
The files might be .o or .c extensions.

[*-a*]::
Additional flags to be passed to *cc*. This must be quoted string. Similar to the
*CFLAGS* environment flag, except that it is passed in command lien for *buildserver*.

This flag is ignored. The logic might change in future and advertise from CLI
might become available.
