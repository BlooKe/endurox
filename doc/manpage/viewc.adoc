NAME
----
viewc - View file compiler


SYNOPSIS
--------
*viewc* ['OPTIONS'] viewfile1 viewfile2 ... viewfileN


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*viewc* binary consume view files defined in format specified of 'viewfile(5)'.
The view file describes the C structure which can be mapped to *UBF* buffer. The
view file contains also the length of the *STRING* and *CARRAY* fields. Program does
following steps:

. Generates C header file with structures according to the view file

. Calculates machine dependent the C field offset in the memory, calculates field
lengths

To perform offset and size calculation, viewc generates small C program which is
compiled by 'buildclient(8)' Perl script. The generated temporary program is executed
which updates the in-memory read view file. The view file is updated with platform
specific data and the "object-file" is written to disk. The object file basically
corresponds the same 'viewfile(5)' format, except that additional meta data for
each of the fields are encoded after the NULL column. Also some meta data are
encoded in view file comments. The "object-file" can be used as original view file
by viewc. In that case viewc will ignore the meta data and will produce new
"object-file".

'viewc' must have access to 'cc' (C Compiler).

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
