EnduroX Development standard
----------------------------
EnduroX build system is CMake. Version used should be 2.8 and above. It uses
Flex and Bison for building UBF (FML) Expressions.

Intension is done with as 4x spaces. EnduroX is programmed in NetBeans c/c++
project. NetBeans supports CMake projects.

Project also uses 'libxml2' (provided by system), 'exhash' (already included in 'include' dir) 
and cgreen (integrated into Enduro/X) for unit testing.

Unit testing
------------

Bot UBF and ATMI sub-systems are unit tested. UBF tests are located under 
'ubftest' folder, which could be run by:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./ubfunit1 2>/dev/null
Running "main"...
Completed "main": 5749 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATMI tests are located at 'atmitest' directory, can be run by:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./run.sh 
tail -n1 test.out
Completed "main": 18 passes, 0 failure, 0 exceptions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Enduro/X libraries
------------------

The framework is composed by following internal libraries and it's dependencies:
[dia, module_dependency.dia, module_dependency.png, x300]
-------------------------------
-------------------------------

Common configuration
--------------------

Enduro/X users are welcome to use common configuration engine. This engine uses
ini files to get key/values from ini section (and subsection with inheritance).
The configuration can point to directory and in that case Enduro/X will read the
all configuration files in directory which ends with with ".ini .cfg, .conf, .config".
Configuration engine will automatically detect that given resource is directory
and will start to scan for files in directory.

The library keeps all ini file data in memory in hash tables, which also can be iterated
as the linked lists. The library can be instructed to refresh the memory configuration.
Refresh function detects any files changed in disk (by time stamp) and reload the data
in memory.

=== Enduro/X common config setup

Enduro/X can be configured by using ini file (or files) instead of environment variables, 
ndrxdebug.conf and q.conf.
Two new environment variables now are added to the system:

1. NDRX_CCONFIG=/path/to/ini/file/or/directory/with/files 

2. And optional NDRX_CCTAG which allows processes to specify the subsection of Enduro/X system settings.

The configurations sections are:

- [@global] - environment variables for process (see ex_env(5))

- [@debug] - debug configuration per binary (see ndrxdebug.conf(5))

- [@queue] - persistent queue configurations.

If you use NDRX_CCTAG or specify the "cctag" for ATMI server, then Enduro/X 
will scan for sections like (e.g. cctag=TAG1):

- [@global/TAG1] and then [@global]

- [@debug/TAG1] and then [@debug]

- [@queue/TAG1] and then [@debug]

cctag can contain multiple tags, which are separated by '/'.
In that case multiple lockups will be made with base section combination.

=== User accessible configuration server

"cconfsrv" XATMI server which can be used by applications to use Enduro/X 
framework for application configuration. The user application can call the 
"@CCONFIG" server in two modes:

A) for getting the exact section;

B) for listing the sections.

See cconfsrv(8) for more details. 

The idea behind this is that user can do the programming under Enduro/X in
 multiple languages (C/Go/Perl/Python/PHP/NodeJS) and these modules typically
needs configuration. It would be waste of time if for each of the languages
developer would need to think how to read the configuration from configuration
files with native libraries. The Enduro/X offers standard XATMI micro-service 
call for reading the ini files in common way for whole application,
no matter in which language it is programmed.

But C/C++ programmers can use Enduro/X direct libraries for configuration processing.
See the 'atmitest/test029_inicfg/atmiclt29.c' for sample code.


=== Common configuration internals
The configuration driving is built in multiple layers:

- Layer 1: Physical file reading by "ini.h" library which gives the 
callback for any parsed key/value/section;

- Layer 2: Enduro/X code named "inicfg.h" and "inicfg.c". This drives the configuration
object loads files into memory. Performs the refreshes, resolves the sections (with inheritance).
Returns the buffers with values.

- Layer 3: High level configuration driving by "cconfig.h" and "cconfig.c". This operates
with Enduro/X environment variables and Enduro/X configuration files.
However you may use different env variables for different purposes. For example:
"NDRX_CCONFIG" variable can point to Enduro/X config, but "NDRX_CCONFIG1" can point to your
application configuration. And this still is valid setup and keeps files separate.

- Layer 4: "cconfsrv". This is high level API, accessible by transaction protocol (TP)
sub-system. See the cconfsrv(8) manpage. Internally is uses Layer 2 and 3 API.

Common Debug logging API - TPLOG
--------------------------------

Enduro/X offer debug logging facility named "TPLOG". TPLog basically stands for extended
user log. The user applications can use this API to configure TPLog, NDRX and UBF logs to
be redirect to specified files, configure levels. Enduro/X introduces concept of request
logging which means that each system request (or session) which processes UBF buffers can
be logged to separate file. Which basically redirects NDRX, UBF and TPLog (user) to specific
file. File can be set by *tplogsetreqfile(5)*.

=== Logging facilities 

- 'NDRX', logging facility code 'N' - this is Enduro/X XATMI framework internal debug logging.
Debug string setting for level is set with keyword 'ndrx'. Facility is defined with macros
*LOG_FACILITY_NDRX*.

- 'UBF', logging facility code 'U' - this is UBF library logs. In debug string level is set with
keyword 'ubf'. Facility is defined with macros 'LOG_FACILITY_UBF'.

- 'TP', logging facility code 't' - this is user logs. In debug string level is set with
keyword 'tp'. Facility is defined with macros 'LOG_CODE_TP'. This is process based logging.

- 'TP_THREAD', logging facility code 'T' - this is user logs, set on per thread basis. The log level
is set with keyword 'tp'. Facility is defined with macros 'LOG_FACILITY_TP_THREAD'.

- 'TP_REQUEST', logging facility code 'R' - this is user logs, set on per thread/request basis. The log level is set with keyword 'tp'. Facility is defined with macros 'LOG_FACILITY_TP_REQUEST'.

=== Hierarchy of the  loggers (facilities)

The loggers output the debug content in following order of the facilities status (i.e. definition of current logger):

- If 'TP_REQUEST' is open (debug file set), then all logging (NDRX, UBF, TP) will go here.
The debug level is shared at application level with NDRX, UBF and TP facilities. There will be no
impact if 'TP_REQUEST' log level is different. The request logging can be open by *tplogsetreqfile(3)*. Logger can be closed by *tplogclosereqfile(3)*.

- If 'TP_THREAD' is open (debug file set), then all logs including NDRX, UBF and TP will log here. Thread logger can be open by doing *tplogconfig(LOG_FACILITY_TP_THREAD, ...)*. Thread logger can be closed by *tplogclosethread(3)*

If there is no TP_REQUEST or TP_THREAD facilities open, then logging is done on per process basis, where there are 3 facilities which are always open:

- 'NDRX', here XATMI sub-system is logged. It can be configured to use separate file by *tplogconfig(3)*.

- 'UBF', here UBF sub-system is logged. It can be configured to use separate file by *tplogconfig(3)*.

- 'TP', here TPLog sub-system is logged. It can be configured to use separate file by *tplogconfig(3)*.


=== Debug string format

The *debug string* format is described in *ndrxdebug.conf(5)* manpage. basically it is following:

- ndrx=<Debug level> ubf=<Debug level> tp=<Debug level> bufsz=<Number of line to write after doing fflush> file=<log file name, if empty, then stderr>

The debug level is one of the following:

0. No logging output

1. Fatal

2. Error

3. Warning 

4. Program info

5. Debug

=== Brief of logging functions

Enduro/X debugging API offers following list of the functions:

==== Part of the standard library (ndebug.h)

- void tplogdump(int 'lev', char *'comment', void *'ptr', int 'len'); - 
Dumps the binary buffer (hex-dump) to current logger

- void tplogdumpdiff(int 'lev', char *'comment', void *'ptr1', void *'ptr2', int 'len'); - 
Compares two binary buffers and prints the hex-dump to current logger

- void tplog(int 'lev', char *'message'); -
Prints the message to current logger, at given log level

- int tploggetreqfile(char *'filename', int 'bufsize'); - 
Get the current request file (see the next chapter)

- int tplogconfig(int 'logger', int 'lev', char *'debug_string', char *'module', char *'new_file');
Configure logger. The loggers can be binary 'ored' and with one function call multiple loggers
can be configured. 'lev' is optional, if not set it must be -1. Debug string is optional, but if have
one then it can contain all elements. 'module' is 4 symbols log module code using in debug lines.
'new_file' if set (not NULL and not EOS(0x00)) then it have priority over the file present in debug string.

- void tplogclosereqfile(void); -
Close request file. The current logger will fall-back to either thread logger (if configured)
or to process loggers.

- void tplogclosethread(void); - 
Close thread logger, if it was configured.

- void tplogsetreqfile_direct(char *filename); -
Set the request file, directly to logger. This operation is used by next function which
allows to store the current request logging function in the XATMI UBF buffer.

==== Part of the XATMI library (xatmi.h)

- int tplogsetreqfile(char **'data', char *'filename', char *'filesvc'); -
Set the request file. If 'data' is UBF buffer allocated by *tpcalloc(3)*, then
it will search for 'EX_NREQLOGFILE' field presence there. If field present,
then 'TP_REQUEST' logger will be set to. If field not present, but 'filename' is set (not NULL and not EOS),
then request logger will be set to this file and name will be loaded into buffer.
If file name is not in the buffer and not in the 'filename' but 'filesvc' present
then this XATMI service will be called with 'data' buffer and it is expected that field
'EX_NREQLOGFILE' will be set which then is used for logging.

- int tploggetbufreqfile(char *'data', char *'filename', int 'bufsize'); -
Get the request logging file name from XATMI buffer, basically this returns
'EX_NREQLOGFILE' value.

- int tplogdelbufreqfile(char *'data'); -
Delete the request logging information from XATMI buffer.

- void tplogprintubf(int 'lev', char *'title', UBFH *'p_ub'); - 
print the UBF buffer to current logger.

=== Request logging concept

Request logging is concept when each user session or transaction which is processed by multiple XATMI
clients and servers, are logged to single trace file. This is very useful when system have high
load with request. Then administrators can identify single transaction and with this request log
file it is possible to view full sequence of operation which system performed. You do not need
anymore to grep the big log files (based on each service output) and glue together the picture
what have happened in system for particular transaction.

The basic use of the request logging is following:

Client process:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* read the request from network & parse
 * get the transaction subject (for example bank card number (PAN))
 * open the log file for each bank card request
 * e.g.
 */

tplogsetreqfile(&p_ub, "/opt/app/logs/pan_based/<PAN>_<Time_stamp>", NULL);

tplog("About to authorize");

tpcall("AUTHORIZE", &p_ub, ...);

/* reply to network */

tplog("Transaction complete");

/* close the logger after transaction complete */
tplogclosereqfile();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Server process - AUTHORIZE service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void AUTHORIZE(TPSVCINFO *p_svc)
{
    UBFH *p_ub = (UBFH *)p_svc->data;

    /* Just print the buffer */
    tplogsetreqfile((char **)&p_ub, NULL, NULL);

    tplogprintubf(log_debug, "AUTHORIZE got request", p_ub);
    
    tplog(log_debug, "Processing...!");

    /* do the work */

	/* close the request file as we are done. */    
    tplogclosereqfile();

    tpreturn(  TPSUCCESS,
                0L,
                (char *)p_ub,
                0L,
                0L);
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Lest assume that for our transaction logfile is set to: '/opt/app/logs/pan_based/5555550000000001_1475008709'
then transaction could look like:

Queuing mechanisms
------------------

Enduro/X originally was developed for GNU/Linux kernels where resource polling sub-system
i.e. epoll() can handle Posix queue handlers. This is linux non-standard feature which 
greatly supports system development. This allows to build one queue - multiple servers
architecture (even for ATMI server processes waiting on different queues). However, this
this feature limits platform to be working on Linux only.

[dia, epoll_message_dispatch_mode.dia, epoll_message_dispatch_mode.png, x300]
-------------------------------
-------------------------------

Starting from Enduro/X version 3, there is support for other Posix compatible Operating
Systems. Where possible Posix queues are used. If no Queueu support built in, for example
Apple OSX, then emulated Posix queues are used. For these platforms, the caller processes
does choose the queue where to send the message in round-robin mode. For each service
shared memory contains list of server IDs providing the service. In round robin mode
the server id is selected, and caller sends the service to queue (e.g. 'dom1,svc,TESTSVC,102'
where '102' is server id.).

[dia, poll_message_dispatch_mode.dia, poll_message_dispatch_mode.png, x450]
-------------------------------
-------------------------------

For other unix support, mq_notify() call for each open queue is installed, by employing
SIGUSR2. Signal handling is done in seperate thread. The main ATMI server thread is doing
'poll()' in unnamed pipe. When event from mq_ sub-system is received, it writes the queue
descriptor id to unnamed pipe and that makes main thread to wake up for queue processing.
The 'poll()' for main thread supports Enduro/X extensions to add some other resource for
polling (e.g. socket fd.)
