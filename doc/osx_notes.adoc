About manual
------------
This manual describes how to build 'Enduro/X' on fresh installed OS X. Document is based
on operatin system version 10.11 (El Capitan).


== Overview
Enduro/X normally use Operating System provided Posix kernel queues, however OS X does not have
this subsystem, however Enduro/X provides queue emulation via POSIX Threads functionality. This
includes process shared semaphores and memory mapped files. Enduro/X CMake scripts will automatically
do the configuration and enable this functionality.

In the result queues will we listed on file system. The recommendation is to use seperate folder this
for example "/tmp/mq".

This document covers only core fucntionality of the Enduro/X building. That's mean that building of:
. documentation;
. gpg-me;
is out of the scope.

== Installation process

=== Packages to be installed

. Apple Xcode (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) install from Appstore or other sources
. Git source code version control system
. CMake (https://cmake.org/install/)

=== Getting the source code
For test purposes we will parepare new user for which Enduro/X will built.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# useradd -m user1
# su - user1
$ cd /home/user1
$ git clone https://github.com/endurox-dev/endurox endurox
---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Enduro/X basic Environment configuration for HOME directory
This code bellow creates 'ndrx_home' executable file which loads basic environment, 
so that you can use sample configuration provided by Enduro/X in 'sampleconfig' directory. 
This also assumes that you are going to install to '$HOME/endurox/dist' folder.


NOTE: If we install the libaries in dist/lib64, OS X will still try for to get the the
shared libraries for origin build folders. Thus it is recommended to configure environment file
bit more advanced, to enable OS X library loader to search orgin lib folders firstly.

NOTE: For test cases like 021 (XA Testing) and 028 (TMQUEUE) tests, the scripts uses
'DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable. Hoever testing scripts are using '/bin/bash',
which means that by enabled SIP (System Integrity Protection), the variable is dropped. Thus 
pass all ATMI tests, you have to disable SIP.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
cat << EOF > $HOME/ndrx_home
#!/bin/bash

# Where app domain lives
export NDRX_APPHOME=/home/user1/endurox
# Where NDRX runtime lives
export NDRX_HOME=/home/user1/endurox/dist/bin
# Debug config too
export NDRX_DEBUG_CONF=/home/user1/endurox/sampleconfig/debug.conf

# NDRX config too.
export NDRX_CONFIG=/home/user1/endurox/sampleconfig/ndrxconfig.xml

# Access for binaries
export PATH=$PATH:/$HOME/endurox/dist/bin

# LIBPATH for .so 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:$HOME/endurox/dist/lib

# UBF/FML field tables
export export FLDTBLDIR=$HOME/endurox/ubftest/ubftab

EOF

$ chmod +x $HOME/ndrx_home
---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Building the code
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd /home/user1/endurox
# If you want to have install folder to /home/user1/endurox/dist
# if you want system level install then run just $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/ .
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd`/dist .
$ make 
$ make install
---------------------------------------------------------------------

== Unit Testing

Enduro/X basically consists of two parts:
. XATMI runtime;
. UBF/FML buffer processing. 
Each of these two sub-systems have own units tests.

=== UBF/FML Unit testing
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd /home/user1/endurox/ubftest
$ ./ubfunit1 2>/dev/null
Running "main"...
Completed "main": 5751 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== XATMI Unit testing
ATMI testing might take some time. Also ensure that you have few Gigabytes of free 
disk space, as logging requires some space. To run the ATMI tests do following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd /home/user1/endurox/atmitest
$ nohup ./run.sh &
$ tail -f /home/user1/endurox/atmitest
...
Setting domain 2
Server executable = tpbridge    Id = 101 :      Shutdown succeeded.
Server executable = convsv21    Id = 50 :       Shutdown succeeded.
Server executable = atmi.sv21   Id = 30 :       Shutdown succeeded.
Server executable = tmsrv       Id = 10 :       Shutdown succeeded.
Shutdown finished. 4 processes stopped.
atmiclt21: no process found
************ FINISHED TEST: [test021_xafull/run.sh] with 0 ************
Running "main"...
Running "main"...
Completed "main": 21 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------


== Conclusions
At finish you have a configured system which is read to process the transactions
by Enduro/X runtime. It is possible to copy the binary version ('dist') folder
to other same architecture machine and run it there with out need of building.
This process is described in <<BINARY_INSTALL>> guide.
