About the guide
---------------
This document describes new configuration principles used in Enduro/X. The configuration is based on
ini files, the in 3.x series the old style configuration files (ndrxdebug.conf, q.conf) are still supported,
but the same format data can be now passed into ini files.

== Moving environment variables to ini files

Enduro/X depend on set of the environment variables which define the basic settings for application server to
start to work. These includes various shared memory settings, queue settings, etc. See the ex_env(5) page for that.

The set of environment variables means that users needs to maintain and set them some how. With the common-configuration
framework, these variables can be defined in ini file in '[@global]' section. When the Enduro/X initializes standard library,
it is searching for 'NDRX_CCONFIG' environment variable presence. If the variable is present, Enduro/X loads into memory
sections which are needed for later processing. From these sections settings from [@global] is automatically loaded
as environment variables for current processing, by using system call 'setenv()'. Thus in this section you may define 
any environment variables you want to see for process which is started.
