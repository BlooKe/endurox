Overview
--------
This document generally contains Enduro/X benchark overview, performed on different platforms.
Different aspects are being tested and performance results are analyzed. Testing will cover
funamental message exchange between client and server, synchrouns and asynchrouns aspects are tested.
Document also covers persistent storage benchmarks.

Local tpcall()
--------------
This test includes locally running ATMI client and ATMI server. The interprocess comunication happens
with help of kernel queues (kq) or shared memory (shm). The polling mechanisms are either epoll() (works
 on linux, most efficient way) and usual poll() for which event chain is bit longer.

From the results can be seen that performance mostly stays stable at different data size loads.

Networked tpcall()
------------------
At this test basically same works is done as for above, but instead two instances of application servers
are started and they are interconnected with network.

Here we see that network peformance slightly fluctate. That could be related with fact now bridge is involved to transfer
the message over the network, and process count is bigger than CPU core count. Thus scheduler comes in work.

Multi-process/multi-thread tpcall()
-----------------------------------
This test cases employs five ATMI servers, and one ATMI client which inside have 5x threads,
sending messagas to the servers
